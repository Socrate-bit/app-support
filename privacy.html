  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>ECOM-PARIS LLC</strong> ("we", "our", "us") collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information when you use our applications or related services.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Usage data (pages visited).</li>
    <li>Technical data (advertising identifiers such as IDFA).</li>
    <li>Image data uploaded by users for AI image generation, which may include faces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve our services and AI image generation features.</li>
    <li>To process user-uploaded images solely for the requested image generation task.</li>
    <li>To respond to user inquiries and customer support requests.</li>
    <li>To send essential updates and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    <li>To display personalized advertising and measure ad performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Advertising and Tracking</h2>
  <p>Our app uses the Apple Advertising Identifier (IDFA) and may integrate third-party SDKs such as <strong>Facebook Ads</strong> to deliver personalized ads and measure campaign performance. This may involve tracking user interactions across apps and websites.</p>
  <p>Users can control or revoke ad tracking permission at any time through their device settings under <strong>Settings → Privacy → Tracking</strong>.</p>

  <h2>4. Face and Biometric Data</h2>
  <p>Our app does <strong>not</strong> analyze, identify, recognize, or extract biometric templates from any face data. However, uploaded images may contain faces for the purpose of generating AI output.</p>
  <p><strong>User photos containing faces are stored in encrypted form and are accessible only to the uploading user. These images can be deleted at any moment from the user interface.</p>

  <h2>5. Image and Face Data Processing and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User photos are transmitted to Google’s Gemini Nano Banana model for image generation.</li>
    <li>Google processes the image only transiently and does <strong>not</strong> store or retain face data or any part of the image.</li>
    <li>All uploaded images, including those containing faces, are stored securely in encrypted form and accessible only to the user. Generated images are also stored in encrypted form. Users may delete any stored image at any time from the app interface. Images are retained only for user access and support functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or share personal data or face data with third parties.</li>
    <li>Third-party advertising partners such as Facebook Ads receive only advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA), not face data.</li>
    <li>Google Gemini receives image data solely for transient processing. Google does not store, retain, or reuse face data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third‑Party Face Data Practices</h2>
  <p>Google Gemini processes image data only in-memory for the duration of the generation task. According to Google’s documented practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No face data is stored.</li>
    <li>No face data is reused for model training.</li>
    <li>No face data is accessible to third parties.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not integrate with any third-party service that stores or retains face data.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect all personal and image data against unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or misuse.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
